# NMEA
Main logger sensor and decoder, to read PNT data from a single UBX ZED 9P.
NTRIP data can be from 
- A local CORS source using an XBEE board
- A remote source, this needs 4G/Wi-Fi etc.
   
The current solution uses a [local CORS relay.](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/gnss/v/cors/local-cors-relay).
